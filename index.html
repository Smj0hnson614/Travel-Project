            <h3>
              Turks and Caicos, home to prestine beaches and the third largest
              barrier reef in the world
            </h3>
            <p>
              The Princess Alexandra National Park is an extensive and important
              protected area in the Turks and Caicos that includes attractions
              such as Grace Bay Beach, the Bight Beach, the Bight Reef (also
              known as Coral Gardens), Smith’s Reef, Leeward Beach, Mangrove
              Cay, and Little Water Cay.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also inside the national park is the barrier reef that protects
              Grace Bay, which features beautiful snorkeling and scuba diving
              locations. One of the top things to do when on vacation in the
              Turks and Caicos is to snorkel on this amazing barrier reef.

                <h4>Turks Kebabs</h4>
                <p>
                  Turks Kebabs is a casual restaurant in Grace Bay that serves
                  Turkish, Mediterranean, and Greek fare, at a decent price.
                  Dishes are made to order and incorporate fresh produce, which
                  makes the restaurant a popular choice with locals and visitors
                  alike. The establishment is also the only place serving true
                  doner kebab in the Turks and Caicos.

                <h5>Why visit Turks Kebabas</h5>
                <p>
                  One of the greatest attractions of Turks Kebab is pide pizza,
                  a unique flatbread style. Choose from classics such as cheese
                  and pepperoni, as well as more-developed flavors, including a
                  Kusbasili meat pizza, Mediterranean, and vegetarian pies. As
                  they are influenced by Turkish pide flat bread, the
                  restaurant’s pizzas have an unusual boat shape, which allows
                  for convenient portions.
